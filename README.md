# I'm lazy af.

### Mac(!) => **[Brew](https://brew.sh/)** needed!

#### To install anything from here for your lazyness, simply run install.sh via curl:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datflowts/fcknlazyflow/master/install.sh)"
```
#### or via wget:
```bash
sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datflowts/fcknlazyflow/master/install.sh)"
```
#### or via fetch:
```bash
sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datflowts/fcknlazyflow/master/install.sh)"
```
#### As an alternative, you can first download the install script and run it afterwards:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datflowts/fcknlazyflow/master/install.sh
./install.sh
```
