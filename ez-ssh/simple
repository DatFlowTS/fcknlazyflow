# This script is for using to connect to a remote host 
# which is directly accessible via SSH.
# In case it's not, consider using the bridged
# script instead.
#
# Edit the following variables to match your purposes:
HOST="remote.domain.tld" # also using an IP address would be fine
CMD="simple" # edit to the filename
DEFUSER="user" # insert your default username on the remote host
VNCPORT=5901 # edit to match the remote hosts VNC port for your user
TUNPORT=5901 # edit to your preferred localhost port which is free
SSHPORT=22 # in case it's not the default port where the ssh server is listening
