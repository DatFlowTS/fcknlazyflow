# This script is for using to connect to a remote host 
# which is not directly accessible via SSH
# because it's not using the default port while other
# ports are blocked locally or it's just not accessible from
# outside its private network.
# 
# You'll still need another host accessible via SSH default port
# in the remote network
#
# Edit the following variables to match your purposes:
HOST="remote.domain.tld" # also using an IP address would be fine
BRIDGEHST="bridge.domain.tld" # same thing as above
CMD="bridged" # edit to the filename
DEFUSER="user" # insert your default username on the remote host
VNCPORT=5901 # edit to match the remote hosts VNC port for your user
TUNPORT=5901 # edit to your preferred localhost port which is free
BRIDGEPORT=9999 # same thing as above - used for SSH to the remote host
SSHPORT=22 # in case it's not the default port where the SSH server is listening
